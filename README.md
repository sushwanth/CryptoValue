The script scrapes https://coinmarketcap.com for every 3 seconds and gives you the values (USD) of each coin provided in the list.   
The std out of the crypto currency value would be red or green when the value increases or decreases respectively.   
New line is printed only if there is a change in value of at least one currency.
